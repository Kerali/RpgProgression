# Personal Research: **RPG Progression**

## Definition of progression

Progression is a game design term that refers to video game mechanics in which the designers set the course of action that the player must complete to move forward in the game.
Progression in video games comes in three different varieties:
- **Player progression:** Refers to the person playing the game improving their skill and knowledge of the design. An example of a title that is based around this progression could be the Souls series, a game series designed around the player getting better at the game to have any chance of winning.
- **Character or Abstract progression:** Refers to the in game character becoming stronger outside the player’s skill. RPGs are the best examples for this.
- **Game progression:** Refers to moving through the various levels or areas of the game until you reach the credits.

## About abstract progression

Abstract progression is how a character or in game avatar grows in power, not the player, so this would be for example, gear in an RPG, leveling up, or similar actions and when it comes to abstract progression, there are two forms of it that the player is going to experience: set and random.

### Set abstract progression

Set abstract progression is the predefined form progression that the developer has in their game, this is going to be about any kind of leveling system, starting to level 1 to 50 to 100 and so on, and as a developer the amount of experience you get, how many levels there are is hard-coded and because of that set progression can vary upon what you are looking to, basically, have the player do. You could have a level cap that takes two hours,to take ten hours, could take 50 to 100 hours, it all depends on what you are trying to do when it comes to set progression. Good game design is about always giving the player something to move them forward, they should always have an idea of “okay I’m here and we’re gonna go over here, now I’m gonna get more experience when I level up and so on. If the player has no idea how they’re progressing, they are going to get frustrated because they don’t know exactly how long this is going to take. With using the class example of an experience UI you have a reasonable idea of “okay I am ¾ of the way there and the enemies are filling up a little part so I have a good idea of when I’m going to level up”. When it comes to set progression again, the more the player can control it or have an idea of what to expect the better is to motivate them, it comes to the classic example of “one more turn” or “I’m going to level up one more time”, “Oh I got something new, let me level up again” and some of the best games ,are the ones that really keep you motivated, always have something new on level up, whether it’s a new power or a new talent, unlocking a new equipment type, a good example would be from Guild Wars 2 and while that game has a reasonably high level curve, but what they did is that every level unlock something new, it could be something as small as a free piece of gear, could be as a large as a new raid or a set encounter unlock, but the point is every time the player levels up, there is something new for them, and that’s the key point. One of the problems with a lot of earlier mmo’s was that there were gaps of levels that there was nothing to do, there was nothing unlocked, World of Warcraft and its original iteration suffered from this problem, there was a huge gap between for example level 40 and level 50, where you leave the player there with nothing to do, they should always be moving forward.

### Random abstract progression

Random abstract progression is typically seen at the end game or level cap, this is when there is no more predefined progression, there is no more skills to unlock, no new talents, nothing like that, instead, we are focusing on equipment and this is where progression can get a little bit polarizing to paying upon a game. With random progression, the key or the plus is that you never know what you’re gonna get, you could be walking around killing random enemies and some epic set ancient item drops in Diablo 3 or some powerful high-end item drops with the division which I’ve been  playing, the problem, though, is the times when that doesn’t happen and it leads to progression becoming instead of a gradual curve, it becomes more of peaks and valleys. You’ll be up, I’m powerful, fine,  good gear, then nothing, about to get something more we just completed this epic encounter and now there is nothing for another hour and this is of course the crux of random progression, you never know what is going to happen. With random progression, one of the best things we have seen to help ease that frustration is to not make it so random and  and that is having ways to manipulating it, in Diablo 3, the difficulty system allows you to increase the challenge of the game and at the same time raise the drop rates and this is very important, if the player can control or have an  understanding of when something good is going to happen, it’s going to  allow them to keep being motivated when they have no real set idea. In Diablo 3, loot and what drops is completely random, we don’t know when it’s gonna drop, we don’t know what’s gonna drop but we do know the conditions for when loot  is gonna drop, for instance when you fight an elite enemy, when you find one of the epic chests, when you beat a boss for the first time, when you complete a rift, these are set elements, they are set situations that  you know it’s gonna happen, you don’t know what that is but you know when you complete the rift you are gonna get something good because  of this it allows the random progression to motivate you, because you know that if you do something, you know something is going to happen. The same thing with The Division, finding locked chests in the dark zone, completing a raid.


Another thing you can do to get around it, is to have ways of acquiring loot, mainly MMOs and RPGs have special vendors, they are there simply for you to not only spend all your hard on resources because there is nothing else but they are used  to help fill a gap, remember, with a random gear and let’s say you can equip 5 or 6 pieces, you are never quite sure if you are going to fill up your gear slots and  that is very important when it comes to a gear rating, but again, having these vendors available, allows you to have some set progression or at least control it if you are having trouble, Diablo 3 does this with the ability to craft new pieces while you are leveling up. These are ways to control the random progression while still having a be your primary source some games tend to go a little bit differently, they will let you find gear on the missions but  the best stuff may only be vendor specific, Diablo and the Division does it. But the key point to keep in mind for progression is that the player should always have an idea as to what they are doing, they should never be wondering what is going to happen next, they should still have some  semblance of knowing, “okay I’m playing this game, I’ve gotten this much experience, I just need this much more to level up, then I unlock a new talent or a new skill gem” and then when they hit the endgame they know “okay I could maybe get  lucky killing random enemies but let me go and do this extra mission with my friends, I don’t know what I’m going to get but I’m guaranteed to get something good. The main point is that with progression, the players should always feel like they are moving forward, if they feel they are wasting their time or going backwards they are going to bounce off the game.
