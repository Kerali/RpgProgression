# Definition of progression

Progression is a game design term that refers to video game mechanics in which the designers set the course of action that the player must complete to move forward in the game.
Progression in video games comes in three different varieties:
- **Player progression:** Refers to the person playing the game improving their skill and knowledge of the design. An example of a title that is based around this progression could be the Souls series, a game series designed around the player getting better at the game to have any chance of winning.
- **Character or Abstract progression:** Refers to the in game character becoming stronger outside the player’s skill. RPGs are the best examples for this.
- **Game progression:** Refers to moving through the various levels or areas of the game until you reach the credits.

# About abstract progression

Abstract progression is how a character or in game avatar grows in power, not the player, so this would be for example, gear in an RPG, leveling up, or similar actions and when it comes to abstract progression, there are two forms of it that the player is going to experience: set and random.

## Set abstract progression

Set abstract progression is the predefined form progression that the developer has in their game, this is going to be about any kind of leveling system, starting to level 1 to 50 to 100 and so on. 

As a developer, the amount of experience you get, how many levels there are is hard-coded and because of that, set progression can vary upon what you are looking to, basically, have the player do. You could have a level cap that takes two hours,to take ten hours, could take 50 to 100 hours, it all depends on what you are trying to do when it comes to set progression. 

Good game design is about always giving the player something to move them forward, they should always have an idea of “okay I’m here and we’re gonna go over here, now I’m gonna get more experience so I can level up" and so on. If the player has no idea how they’re progressing, they are going to get frustrated because they don’t know exactly how long this is going to take. With using the classic example of an experience UI, you have a reasonable idea of how many experience you need to level up and you know which enemies or tasks will be easier for you to get to the maximum experience. 

When it comes to set progression again, the more the player can control it or have an idea of what to expect the better is to motivate them, it comes to the classic example of “one more turn” or “I’m going to level up one more time”, “Oh I got something new, let me level up again” and some of the best games, are the ones that really keep you motivated, always have something new on level up, whether it’s a new power or a new talent, unlocking a new equipment type...

### Example

A good example would be Guild Wars 2, although having a reasonably high level curve, but what they did is that every level up, would unlock something new for the player. It could be something as small as a free piece of gear, could be a new raid or any type of reward, but the point is that the player will get something new every time he/she levels up and will keep the player motivated to go forward.

## Random abstract progression

Random abstract progression is typically seen at the end game or at the level cap, this is when there is no more predefined progression, there is no more skills to unlock, no new talents, nothing like that, instead, we are focusing on equipment and this is where progression can get a little bit random. 
With random progression, the key or the plus is that you never know what you’re gonna get, you could be walking around killing random enemies and some epic set ancient item drops in Diablo 3 or some powerful high-end item drops in The Division. 

The main problem of this type of progression is a wrong feeling transmitted to the player that probably thinks that he will get something every time, but that's not correct. Random progression is a progression based on peaks and valleys, you can be at the top and then you can drop. It can be really good when the players gets gear or money while they do things, but when that does not happen, the player will feel disappointed since there is no reward. That is random progression, you never know what is going to happen.

Some solutions for this problem could be: manipulating that randomness, so the player has an idea of how he will evolve during the game and how the drops will be affected, implementing vendors in game to get gear, so the player makes sure he will have all the gear needed, or having any way for the player to get the items he want, like crafting your own items.


### Example
One of the best things we have seen to help ease that frustration as said above, is to not make it so random and that is having ways to manipulating it, in Diablo 3, the difficulty system allows you to increase the challenge of the game and at the same time raise the drop rates and this is very important, if the player can control or have an  understanding of when something good is going to happen, it’s going to  allow them to keep being motivated when they have no real set idea. 

In Diablo 3, loot and what drops is completely random, we don’t know when it’s gonna drop, we don’t know what’s gonna drop but we do know the conditions for when loot  is gonna drop, for instance when you fight an elite enemy, when you find one of the epic chests, when you beat a boss for the first time, when you complete a rift, these are set elements, they are set situations that you know it’s gonna happen, you don’t know what that is but you know when you complete the rift that you are gonna get something good because  of this, it allows the random progression to motivate you, because you know that if you do something, you know something is going to happen.
